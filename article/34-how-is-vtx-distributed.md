A- 800M VTX is allocated to the vDex main pool, which redistributes transaction fees to Nodes, stakers and contributors and is the source of Node and operator subsidies.
B- 455M VTX is only accessible by voting on proposals to incentivize community contributions such as marketing and social incentives as well as referral games, security updates, developments, partnerships, or anything else anyone wants to propose.
C- 156M are distributed to the core contributors over a 4 year lockup period
