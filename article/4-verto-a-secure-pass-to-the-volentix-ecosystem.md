VOLENTIX LABS is developing a digital application known as VERTO, an innovative downloadable wallet to support peer-to-peer digital asset transactions while ameliorating the risks of using a centralized third-party exchange.
VERTO will hold VTX, a native utility token to be issued for use in the VOLENTIX ecosystem to operate and manage its various functionalities, especially the other pillars of the VOLENTIX ecosystem: the decentralized exchange VDEX, the promotion and marketing platform VENUE, and the user interface and ratings research tool VESPUCCI.
An initial version of VERTO expects to deliver basic UX/UI functions, including VTX balance data. A second generation VERTO expects to provide interactive functionality to manage relationships with other users within the VOLENTIX ecosystem and to access meaningful tools afforded by the other core applications. â€¦
