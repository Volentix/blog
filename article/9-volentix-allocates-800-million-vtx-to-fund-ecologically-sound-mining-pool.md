The Volentix digital assets ecosystem announces it plans to allocate 800,000,000 VTX, the native digital asset of the Volentix project, to support an ecologically-sound solution to authentication of transactions on the VDEX decentralized cross-blockchain exchange being constructed on customized EOS.io technology. Volentix plans to authorize a total native digital asset supply of 2.1 billion VTX for all purposes, including 1.3 billion VTX as a circulating supply and 800,000,000 VTX to support a draw-down mining pool for transaction authentication.
