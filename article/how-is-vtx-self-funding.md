Transaction fees are collected from transactions in the currencies being swapped, they are used to place buy orders for VTX at market price.    
This generates constant demand for VTX by the network itself.  
This self funding mechanism is at the heart of the Volentix eco-system and will become increasingly valuable as more services like staking and voting gain utility.
