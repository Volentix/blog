The Volentix Dev team has included the BTC chain on the vDex node. By doing so we are keeping the network running in a decentralized fashion so that anybody at any time can be able to process transactions on the vDex.  
This way the community plays its role in decentralization and receives subsidies by from a cryptocurrency that is used as a fee mechanism for the exchanges.  
Transaction fees collected are used to buy VTX from the open market.
