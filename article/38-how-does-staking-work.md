When you hold VTX, you can interact with the smart contract to Stake some or all of your tokens to the staker pool.
You choose how many VTX you want to stake and how long you would like to Stake for.
While your VTX is in the staker pool, it earns a % from that pool for up to 300 days, proportional to the size of your stake and its length (the longer you stake, the greater the return). At the end of the Stake, your VTX and any additional VTX earned during the staking period are paid out.
