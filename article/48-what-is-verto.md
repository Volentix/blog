VERTO, an innovative wallet that supports peer-to-peer digital asset transactions while eliminating the risks of using a centralized exchange.  
VERTO helps you manage thousands of tokens including VTX, the native utility token issued for use in the VOLENTIX ecosystem to operate and manage its various functionalities like staking, voting, and submitting public proposals.  
VERTO owners maintain control of their private keys on their local device so that custody of assets is not ceded to third parties. VERTO, therefore, seeks to eliminate the hacking and error-based risks associated with trusting a third-party intermediary.
